							<h2>Gifts & The Letter</h2>
							<p>The door had burst open, and to Splootie's surprise, Hagrid, Santa and Hegwig were in his living room. There was no time for questions, Hagrid and Santa were on a mission! Hagrid told Splootie that he was the only one who could get this important letter to Priya that was super urgent to be delivered (which was great, as Splootie wanted to go to see Priya, so it was a win-win). Santa was just being lazy this Christmas and wanted give Priya her presents via Splootie. So Splootie quickly got up and got his stuff packed, carrying the essential items, such as his walking stick, the Letter and the Gift, and set off to see Priya for Christmas!</p>
