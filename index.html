							<h2>Splootie on Christmas Eve</h2>
							<p>It's Christmas Eve and Splootie is in his house, dreaming about his beautiful Girlfiend Elephant named Priya (coincidence right?!).  It had been a tiring day for Splootie. However, nothing, I mean NOTHING, could prepare Splootie for what was about to happen next to wake him up from his dream.</p>

							<h2>The Gift & The Letter</h2>
							<p>The door had burst open, and to Splootie's surprise, Hagrid, Santa and Hegwig were in his living room. There was no time for questions, Hagrid and Santa were on a mission! Hagrid told Splootie that he was the only one who could get this important letter to Priya that was super urgent to be delivered (which was great, as Splootie wanted to go to see Priya, so it was a win-win). Santa was just being lazy this Christmas and wanted give Priya her present via Splootie. So Splootie quickly got up and got his stuff packed, carrying the essential items, such as his walking stick, the Letter and the Gift, and set off to see Priya for Christmas!</p>

Splootie explained what was going on, and the crew couldn't understand why Hagrid and Santa were kicking it together in this weird cross-over, but Splootie said there was time to explain! The guys didn't question further and accomponied Splootie on this adventure.</p>

As she waited, she was sad, and wished he was close by. However, as she was looking out the window, she saw a purple figure in the distance. It couldn't be..... could it?!
